# OITCodeChallenge
Project Name: Roman Numeral and Integer Converter

Project Description: This basic program can convert integers to Roman Numerals as well as Roman Numerals to integers.

Files included in this repo:

OITCodeChallenge.exe - This is the executable file. It should run on any Windows computer. It gives a demonstration of the capabilities of the code.
To do that, you need to download the file and run it.

Program.cs - This file includes all of the source code for the program.

CodeChallengeNotes.txt - This text document includes all the notes I created as I developed the program. I tried my best to show my line of thinking.

OITCodeChallenge.sln - In case you want to open the Visual Studio file

As requested in the email, the programming portion of this challenge took around three hours from start to finish. This includes brainstorming and outlining.
The rest of the time I spend commenting code, refining notes, and organizing the repository.

Thank you for the challenge! Please let me know if anything vital is missing.
